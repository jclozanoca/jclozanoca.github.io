## Current themes
- Cyber-physical systems (CPS) security
- Power-grid protocol security (e.g., IEC 61850)
- Attack simulation, detection, and evaluation methodologies
- Machine Learning for city planning 

## Selected projects
### Analyzing IEC 61850 module of Industrial Control Malware
In this project, I run on a Sandbox Industroyer malware to understand their behaviour on a Substation.
Conclusions include 36 fast ON-OFF cycles that aimed to perturb control breakers.

### HoneyPot for Industrial Control Systems 
This work aimed to recreate devices on an electrical substation, to do so, we captured device fingerprints of several PLC and other equipment, and integrate it to a honeynet. 
We then evaluated how realistic it was by using standard reconnaissance tools. This constitutes an important mechanism to understand attacker behaviours.
